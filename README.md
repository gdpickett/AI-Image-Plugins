# Don-Panes Easy Diffusion Plugin

	This repo provides access to the Don-Panes Easy Diffusion Plugin

	The plugin does several different things. 

	Currently, this plugin does the following:
	- Adds a Make Similar x 2 button to generated images. This uses your parallel settings and  steps to produce 10 images similar to selected image.
	- Adds a Save to favorites button to generated images, which defaults to C://AI_Favorites. This is useful if you're on a mobile and want an image saved separately to the server.
	- Adds a Collapse Panels tab at the top, which collapses all panels, even for newly generated panels. However it only opens panels which were open when it was initially clicked and newer panels.
	- Adds color to Make Similar x 2 panels and Save To Favorites panels. Also, while these panels are waiting to generate images it tells you in the panel this info and how many images it's going to make.
	- Closing and opening the Collapse Panels tab also adds these buttons to the main image of all panels that have a main image. You have to do it again for any newer main images you'd like to use the Make Similar x 2 and Save to favorites button on.

	I modified some code from Patrice, Avidgamer, so I thank them and the makers of Easy Diffusion for make this possible.
